# Notes on volumes:
# Put/mount your executable files into "/etc/periodic/15min/", "/etc/periodic/hourly/", "/etc/periodic/daily/", "/etc/periodic/weekly/", "/etc/periodic/monthly/" to schedule with cron.
# Put/mount your custom crontab file to "/etc/crontabs/root" for arbitrary scheduling. (Syntax is like Debian's "/etc/cron.d/*" but without username)

# e.g.: echo "Hello World" >>/var/log/cron.log 2>&1
